## Agentic AI LangGraph Tutorial
This repository contains a hands-on tutorial for building a single AI research agent using LangGraph, Tavily, and OpenAI. 
The agent autonomously searches the web, extracts forward-looking AI predictions, clusters related signals, scores trends based on trust and consensus, and presents the results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard. 
This project demonstrates what agentic workflows look like in practice—goal-driven planning, tool usage, iterative reasoning, and synthesis—without relying on multi-agent complexity. 
You can run everything locally, explore ranked AI trends for 2026, and reuse the architecture for other research or intelligence use cases.
